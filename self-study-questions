1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website? = An adaptive website's layout widths are still hardcoded at each media query, and it has quick deployment for specific devices. A fully responsive website uses responsive units throughout the site, and it accommodates thousands of devices and takes longer to build.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first. = Mobile first is when you design a site with a mobile device in mind first and then you change the layout as the screen expands. It uses min-width media queries. Desktop first is when you design a site with a desktop in mind first and then you change the layout as the screen minimizes. It uses max-width media queries.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units? = It converts rem units by the power of 10 instead of 16, which makes our calculations easier.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS? = It provides more syntax for CSS written in a different language. It makes developing websites easier, more efficient, and it lowers the probabitlity of errors. The language we use to write our code is then compiled into normal CSS.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? = My favorite concept is the organization of all of the code. It separates things well and makes working with the code more manageable. The nested at-rules give me the most trouble.
